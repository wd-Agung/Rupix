## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- pnpm (recommended) or npm
- AI API key (for AI assistant functionality)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd project-a
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Create a .env.local file in the root directory
cp .env.example .env.local

# Add your Google AI API key to .env.local
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
```

4. Get your Google AI API key:
   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the API key to your `.env.local` file

5. Run the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the design tool.

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Select a Tool**: Choose from selection, shapes, text, or image tools in the toolbar
2. **Create Objects**: Click on the canvas to add shapes or text
3. **Modify Properties**: Use the properties panel to change colors, sizes, and styles
4. **Manage Layers**: Organize objects using the layers panel
5. **Export Design**: Save your work in various formats

### AI Assistant (Work In Progress)

The AI assistant can directly manipulate your canvas through natural language commands. Here are some example interactions:

**Creating Objects:**
- "Create a blue rectangle at position 100, 150"
- "Add a red circle in the center"
- "Make a text that says 'Hello World' at the top left"

**Modifying Objects:**
- "Move the selected object to the right by 50 pixels"
- "Make the circle bigger by scaling it to 1.5x"
- "Rotate the rectangle 45 degrees"
- "Change the color to green"

**Canvas Management:**
- "Change the background to light gray"
- "Select the first object"
- "Delete the selected object"

The AI will execute these commands directly on your canvas and provide feedback about the actions performed.
